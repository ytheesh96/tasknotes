/**
 * Issue #1722: Inline task conversion creates duplicates in Kanban view until refresh
 *
 * Bug Description:
 * When an inline task on a note is converted into a tasknote, a duplicate of the task
 * is shown in the Kanban view until the view is closed and reopened. Both the old inline
 * task entry and the new tasknote file appear as separate cards.
 *
 * Root cause:
 * When converting an inline task to a tasknote file, the Bases data layer receives the new
 * file event and adds it to the data set. However, the stale inline task entry (keyed by
 * source file path + line) may persist in the KanbanView's currentTaskElements map and
 * taskInfoCache until a full data refresh from Bases removes the old inline item.
 * The KanbanView.handleTaskUpdate() calls debouncedRefresh(), but if Bases hasn't removed
 * the old inline item from its query results, both entries appear.
 *
