# TaskNotes Architecture

This document records the intended high-level boundaries in the TaskNotes plugin.

## Design Goals

- Keep task data markdown-native and portable.
- Isolate Obsidian/Bases/runtime integration from domain logic.
- Minimize direct dependencies on `TaskNotesPlugin`.
- Keep UI modules focused on rendering and interaction, not persistence.

## Main Layers

### Plugin Shell

`src/main.ts`

Owns:

- plugin lifecycle
- settings load/save orchestration through the typed settings persistence helper
- workspace command entry points
- integration registration
- delegation into bootstrap and services

Should not own:

- detailed business logic
- view rendering logic
- low-level task mutation logic
- settings migration and default-merge rules

### Bootstrap

`src/bootstrap/`

Owns:

- service construction
- startup sequencing
- date rollover timer orchestration that emits refresh events
- default Bases file creation/regeneration orchestration
- synchronous Bases view unregistration during plugin unload
- layout-ready initialization
- lazy initialization of optional/heavy services

Should not own:

- business rules
- task parsing
- long-lived presentation behavior

### Settings Persistence

`src/settings/settingsPersistence.ts`

Owns:

- plugin `data.json` path resolution and retry-aware startup reads
- settings-load compromised-state decisions before defaults can be saved
- legacy settings migrations and nested default merging
- settings-only save snapshots that preserve non-settings persisted plugin data

Should not own:

- plugin lifecycle
- settings UI rendering
- runtime side effects that happen after settings are saved

### Domain Services

`src/services/`

Own:

- task creation and mutation
- task creation/update runtime contracts that expose only the app, settings,
  mapper, cache, event, and optional sync surfaces those services need
- filtering runtime contracts that expose only user-field settings, overdue
  policy, i18n, Obsidian link resolution, and project-subtask lookup
- current-note conversion planning for turning note frontmatter and markdown
  body into an edit-modal `TaskInfo`
- task title normalization for filename and frontmatter storage boundaries
- single-property update planning for normalized task values and frontmatter writes
- bulk task-update planning for time-entry sanitation, recurrence adjustments,
  mapped frontmatter mutation, explicit field removals, and returned task state
- archive state and archive move planning
- task start/stop/delete time-entry planning and duration cleanup
- recurring task completion/skip instance planning
- blocking relationship propagation planning
- post-write property-change side effects such as cache refresh, events,
  webhooks, calendar sync, and auto-archive
- filtering, grouping, sorting
- filter predicate evaluation for query groups, user fields, project links,
  subtask lookup, and completion state
- agenda date selection and overdue/recurrence eligibility
- recurrence and time tracking logic
- external provider coordination

Should not own:

- direct DOM rendering
- plugin startup sequencing

### Data Access and Adapters

`src/utils/TaskManager.ts`, `src/bases/`, UI adapter helpers

Own:

- metadata-cache-backed task reads
- task-frontmatter identification and mapped task-info assembly through focused
  helpers
- conversion between Bases data and TaskNotes representations
- frontmatter/property coercion at integration boundaries
- Bases property mapping through `PropertyMappingService`, which depends on the
  stable `FieldMapper` contract rather than a full plugin instance

Should not own:

- view-specific rendering policy
- unrelated UI decisions

Current extracted examples include:

- `src/utils/taskIdentification.ts` owns tag/property task-frontmatter
  identification, including Obsidian metadata-cache tag prefixes, hierarchical
  task tags, list-valued identifying properties, and boolean-like property
  settings.
- `src/utils/taskInfoAssembly.ts` owns final `TaskInfo` assembly from
  FieldMapper output, including path identity, display defaults, computed
  tracked time, and blocking flags.

### Views, Modals, and UI Components

`src/bases/`, `src/views/`, `src/modals/`, `src/ui/`

Own:

- rendering
- user interaction wiring
- view state persistence/restoration
- invoking service operations

Should not own:

- raw persistence rules
- duplicated query semantics

TaskCard and TaskModal should continue moving toward rendering and interaction
wiring only. New state helpers should use narrow interfaces or plain data
structures instead of importing `TaskNotesPlugin` unless they truly need plugin
runtime services. When a helper does need runtime services, keep the surface
action-specific rather than mixing service calls into DOM construction.

## Important Boundaries

### Task Mutations

Task creation, update, recurrence transitions, archive toggles, and relationship writes should flow through `TaskService` and its collaborators, not ad hoc UI code.

`TaskCreationService` and `TaskUpdateService` should depend on their exported
runtime interfaces instead of the full `TaskNotesPlugin` type. The facade can
still pass the plugin object structurally, but the service contract should make
the required app/settings/mapper/cache/event/sync surface explicit.

Task-title sanitization belongs in `src/services/task-service/taskTitleSanitizer.ts`
so filename safety and stored-title safety stay explicit and independently
tested.

Single-property update planning belongs in
`src/services/task-service/taskPropertyUpdate.ts` so status completion dates,
checkbox-backed status values, empty date cleanup, dependency serialization, and
date-modified writes stay explicit before `TaskService` performs the vault
write.

Bulk task-update planning belongs in
`src/services/task-service/taskUpdatePlanning.ts` so edit-modal/API update
payloads sanitize legacy time-entry duration fields, plan recurrence
scheduled/due/DTSTART adjustments, apply mapped frontmatter removals, preserve
custom frontmatter semantics, and assemble the returned `TaskInfo` before
`TaskUpdateService` performs vault writes and side effects.

Archive state and archive move planning belongs in
`src/services/task-service/taskArchivePlanning.ts` so archived field toggling,
date-modified writes, and archive/tasks destination path construction stay
tested outside the Obsidian file-move side effects.

Time-tracking start/stop planning belongs in
`src/services/task-service/taskTimeTrackingPlanning.ts` so active time-entry
selection, legacy duration cleanup, end-time writes, delete-index validation,
and `timeEntries` frontmatter mutation rules stay tested outside the
active-session, vault-write, cache, event, and webhook side effects.

Recurring task completion/skip planning belongs in
`src/services/task-service/taskRecurringPlanning.ts` so action-date selection,
complete/skipped instance mutation, DTSTART updates, next scheduled/due
advancement, and recurrence frontmatter writes stay tested outside vault writes,
body checkbox resets, cache, events, webhooks, and calendar sync.

Blocking relationship propagation planning belongs in
`src/services/task-service/taskBlockingRelationships.ts` so blocked task path
deduplication, reverse `blockedBy` add/remove decisions, relative dependency
link construction, and raw dependency metadata preservation stay tested outside
cache reads and child task writes.

Post-write property side effects belong in
`src/services/task-service/taskPropertyChangeSideEffects.ts`; `TaskService`
keeps the public facade used by views, while the collaborator owns cache
refresh, dependent-task refresh events, webhooks, calendar sync, and
auto-archive routing.

### Filtering and Grouping

Query planning, predicate evaluation, sorting, grouping, and label formatting should be separate concerns even if they remain behind the same facade during migration.

Current extracted examples:

- `src/services/filter-service/FilterQueryPlanner.ts` owns index-backed
  candidate task selection before `FilterService` evaluates complete filter
  predicates.
- `src/services/filter-service/userFieldValues.ts` owns custom user-field list
  token normalization, filter-value coercion, sort comparison, group bucket
  selection, and hierarchical group labels without depending on the plugin or
  Obsidian metadata cache.
- `src/services/filter-service/filterTaskGrouping.ts` owns task grouping,
  project/tag fan-out, date bucket labels, completed-date labels, and group
  header ordering behind injected translation, locale, status, priority,
  project-resolution, and frontmatter-value callbacks.
- `src/services/filter-service/filterTaskSorting.ts` owns task sorting, date
  comparison, natural fallback ordering, tag ordering, and user-field sort
  comparison behind injected status, priority, and frontmatter-value callbacks.
- `src/services/filter-service/filterOptions.ts` owns filter-option assembly,
  task-folder extraction, and dynamic user-property definitions behind injected
  status, priority, cache-derived option, task-path, root-label, and user-field
  sources.
- `src/services/filter-service/filterQueryState.ts` owns default filter query
  construction, quick-toggle query mutation, and partial query normalization.

### Bases Integration

Treat Bases as an integration boundary. TaskNotes should normalize the subset of Bases APIs it depends on into local adapter types rather than spreading `any`-based access across views.

Current extracted examples include Calendar event builders, event-mount list-card
rendering, property-event mutation planning, config snapshots, and
data-signature helpers, initial-date/navigation planning, Kanban task grouping,
column/swimlane ordering, and drag planning, Kanban task-creation default
planning, Task List drag/drop insertion geometry, Task List grouped render
planning, shared Bases selection UI behavior, Bases task creation assembly,
filter-default extraction for Bases-created tasks, Kanban drop status-derivative
and side-effect planning, shared Bases formula/property-map adapters, TaskCard
property access, TaskCard relationship expansion rendering, TaskCard metadata
assembly and metadata-line adapter wiring, TaskCard render-state assembly,
TaskCard completion-state refresh, TaskCard primary indicator rendering,
TaskCard secondary badge rendering, TaskCard title/link rendering, TaskCard
context-menu integration, TaskCard quick-action wiring, and TaskCard indicator
helpers, plus TaskModal action state/menu
adapters, creation form-state defaults, creation subtask assignment, edit
form-state defaults, edit-change state assembly, edit subtask mutation
planning, title-input behavior, details/right-column layout transitions, mobile
focus/keyboard guards, details-editor adapter wiring, field-rendering dispatch,
metadata field construction, and organization list-field construction.

### Logging and User Notices

Diagnostics should route through `createTaskNotesLogger(...)` from
`src/utils/tasknotesLogger.ts` when a module needs structured context, debug
gating, or a category suitable for triage.

Use the shared categories consistently:

- `validation`: invalid input or unsupported values
- `persistence`: vault, frontmatter, or write failures
- `provider`: external integration or host API failures
- `configuration`: missing settings, unavailable plugins, or incompatible APIs
- `stale-data`: cache or metadata freshness issues
- `internal`: unexpected TaskNotes logic failures

Debug logs must be gated by `settings.enableDebugLogging` where plugin settings
are available. Warnings and errors should include an `operation` and optional
structured `details` rather than assembling ad hoc console strings.

Current Phase G examples include Bases API/view diagnostics, Kanban drag debug
events, TaskCard context-menu failures, task-link detection, and markdown-widget
context checks.

## Migration Direction

The refactor strategy is incremental:

1. move construction and startup orchestration out of `src/main.ts`
2. split large service modules behind stable facades
3. tighten types at integration edges
4. split large UI modules after domain seams are clearer
5. record new seams in focused tests and the refactor smoke checklist

The goal is not a rewrite. The goal is to reduce coupling while preserving behavior.
