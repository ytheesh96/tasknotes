# Features Settings

These settings allow you to enable, disable, and configure the various features of the plugin, such as inline tasks, natural language processing, the Pomodoro timer, and notifications.

## Inline Tasks

Inline task settings control how aggressively TaskNotes turns plain note content into structured task interactions. **Task link overlay** enables the Live Preview card behavior for task links, while **Instant task convert** surfaces conversion buttons next to list items and checkboxes. **Keep checkbox when converting** leaves the original Markdown checkbox marker in the source note when a checkbox becomes a TaskNote link. For conversion output, **Inline task convert folder** sets destination behavior and supports `{{currentNotePath}}`, and **Use task defaults on instant convert** applies your default task values at conversion time.

## Body Template

Body template settings let you scaffold newly created tasks with consistent note content. When enabled, TaskNotes reads the configured template file and expands variables like `{{title}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{priority}}`, `{{status}}`, `{{contexts}}`, `{{tags}}`, and `{{projects}}`.

Materialized occurrence notes can use a separate template. Set **Occurrence note template file** to provide a global fallback for occurrence notes; a recurring task's `occurrence_template` frontmatter field takes priority when it is set. If neither occurrence-specific template is configured, occurrence notes continue through the normal body template behavior.

## Natural Language Processing

NLP settings define how text input is interpreted during task capture. **Enable natural language task input** activates date and metadata parsing, **Default to scheduled** changes ambiguous date handling, **NLP language** selects parsing patterns, and **Status suggestion trigger** controls optional status autocomplete activation.

Wrap text in double quotes, single quotes, or backticks to keep it as literal title text during NLP parsing. For example, `BIO "123H" - HW1` keeps `123H` in the title instead of treating it as a 123-hour estimate, while `Review "Today" notes` keeps `Today` as text instead of parsing it as a date.

## Pomodoro Timer

Pomodoro settings control interval lengths, long-break cadence, optional auto-start behavior, and end-of-session notifications/sound. **Pomodoro data storage** chooses whether history is kept in plugin data or daily notes.

## Notifications

Use this section to enable reminders globally, choose whether notices are shown in-app or through system notifications, and optionally play a built-in reminder sound with its own volume control.

## Performance & Behavior

Performance and behavior toggles let you refine overhead and interaction feel: exclude completed tasks from overdue calculations, disable indexing for very large vaults, and tune suggestion debounce timing.

## Time Tracking

Time tracking options handle completion behavior. You can automatically stop running timers when a task is completed and optionally show a confirmation notification.

## Recurring Tasks

Use **Maintain due date offset in recurring tasks** to keep due/scheduled spacing consistent when recurring tasks roll forward.

Occurrence note behavior is configured per recurring task from the task context menu: open **Recurrence → Occurrence notes** to choose manual creation or automatic creation of the next materialized occurrence after completion. See [Recurring Tasks](../features/recurring-tasks.md#materialized-occurrence-notes) for the workflow and storage model.

## Timeblocking

Timeblocking enables lightweight daily-note scheduling blocks and controls whether those blocks are visible by default in calendar views.

### Usage

In the calendar view, click and drag on a time slot to select a time range. A context menu will appear—select "Create timeblock" to create a timeblock (this option only appears if timeblocking is enabled in settings). Drag existing timeblocks to move them. Resize edges to adjust duration.
