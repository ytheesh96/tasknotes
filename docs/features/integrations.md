# Integrations

TaskNotes integrates with external services and Obsidian's core plugins.


## Bases Core Plugin

TaskNotes v4 uses Obsidian's Bases core plugin for its main views (Task List, Kanban, Calendar, Agenda). Bases must be enabled in `Settings -> Core Plugins`.

For details on Bases integration, see [Core Concepts](../core-concepts.md#bases-integration).

## External Calendars

TaskNotes supports bidirectional sync with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook via OAuth, plus read-only access to any calendar via ICS subscriptions.

For setup instructions, see [Calendar Integration](calendar-integration.md).

## HTTP API

A REST API enables external applications to create, update, and query tasks. Use it for automation, browser extensions, or custom integrations.

For API documentation, see [HTTP API](../HTTP_API.md).

## Webhooks

Webhooks send task event payloads to external services when subscribed events occur. Optional payload transformations support service-specific formats.

For configuration, see [Webhooks](../webhooks.md).

## Companion Plugins

Companion plugins run inside Obsidian alongside TaskNotes and use the JavaScript runtime API for live task operations. They are useful when an integration needs a real Obsidian UI, command-palette commands, or vault-local configuration files.

For the companion-plugin model and guides for Canvas Bases and TaskNotes Workflows, see [Companion Plugins](../companion-plugins.md).
