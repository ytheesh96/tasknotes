# Agenda View


The Agenda view is a dedicated `.base` file that opens the calendar in list mode. It provides a scrollable agenda of upcoming tasks, notes, and external calendar events without needing to switch the primary calendar into list view manually.

## File Location

- Default file: `TaskNotes/Views/agenda-default.base`
- Command: **Open Agenda View** (ribbon icon and command palette)
- Configure the file path in **Settings → TaskNotes → General → View Commands**

TaskNotes creates missing default `.base` files automatically on startup when **Auto-create default files** is enabled. You can replace the command path with your own `.base` file if you maintain multiple agendas.

## Default Configuration

The stock agenda file renders the calendar in `listWeek` mode:

```yaml
views:
  - type: tasknotesCalendar
    name: "Agenda"
    calendarView: "listWeek"
    listDayCount: 7
    startDateProperty: file.ctime
    titleProperty: file.basename
    order:
      - note.status
      - note.priority
      - note.due
      - formula.dueIn
      - note.scheduled
```

This configuration displays seven days at a time, derives entries from `file.ctime`/`file.basename`, shows the generated `Due in` countdown next to due dates, and inherits the same display options (show scheduled/due/recurring/timeblocks/time entries/ICS events) as the primary calendar view.

## Customization

Edit the `.base` file to tailor the agenda:

- Change `calendarView` to `listDay` or `listMonth` for different spans
- Adjust `listDayCount` for shorter or longer agendas; the Bases option supports up to 365 days
- Add `filters` to focus on specific projects, tags, or statuses
- Modify `order` to control which task properties appear in the row layout

Because the view runs inside Bases, any YAML changes are applied immediately after saving the file.

## Usage Tips

- Use the calendar toolbar arrows (Previous/Next) to move the agenda window forward or backward, or simply scroll the list to review upcoming entries
- Saved views within Bases let you maintain multiple agenda variants (e.g., "Work Week" vs. "Personal")
- Calendar display options (show due, show scheduled, etc.) persist when you save the `.base` file, so you can maintain one agenda that includes external events and another that focuses strictly on TaskNotes tasks
