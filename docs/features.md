# Features

TaskNotes includes task organization, time tracking, and calendar integration features.

## Task Management

TaskNotes gives each task a structured set of properties, including status, priority, due and scheduled dates, tags, contexts, and optional estimates. Because these values live in frontmatter, they stay readable and portable while still powering advanced filtering and grouping in Bases.

Reminders can be relative (for example, "3 days before due") or absolute, and completed tasks can be archived automatically to keep active work surfaces focused. Recurring tasks can stay virtual for lightweight checkoff workflows, or you can materialize individual occurrences into normal task notes when a specific instance needs its own checklist, comments, time tracking, or attachments. Occurrence notes inherit useful planning metadata from the parent while keeping their own completion state and time entries, and calendar views coalesce them with the matching virtual recurrence instance.

See [Task Management](features/task-management.md) for details.
For recurrence behavior, see [Recurring Tasks](features/recurring-tasks.md).
For reminder setup and data format, see [Task Reminders](features/reminders.md).

## Filtering and Views

TaskNotes uses Obsidian's Bases engine for filtering, sorting, and grouping. Each view is a `.base` file, so you can inspect or edit its query logic directly instead of relying on hidden plugin state.

This design also makes view customization practical: you can duplicate a default view, tweak grouping or formulas, and keep both versions side by side in your vault.

For details on how Bases integration works, see [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md#bases-integration). For Bases syntax documentation, see the [official Obsidian Bases documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Bases/Introduction+to+Bases).

## Inline Task Integration

Inline task features let you work from normal notes without context switching. Task links can display interactive cards, checkboxes can be converted into full task notes, and project notes can surface subtasks and dependency relationships in place.

Natural language parsing supports date, priority, and context extraction across multiple languages, which helps keep fast capture while preserving structured data.

See [Inline Task Integration](features/inline-tasks.md) for details.

## Time Management

Time tracking records work sessions per task, and Pomodoro mode supports focused intervals with break handling. Over time, the statistics views help you compare estimated versus actual effort and spot trends in workload distribution.

## Calendar Integration

TaskNotes supports bidirectional OAuth sync with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook, plus read-only ICS subscriptions for external feeds. Calendar views include month, week, day, year, and list modes, and drag-and-drop scheduling can update tasks directly.

For planning workflows, time-blocking and calendar-linked task updates connect backlog management with schedule execution in the same workspace.

See [Calendar Integration](features/calendar-integration.md) for details.

## User Fields

User fields let you extend the core model with vault-specific metadata like client, energy level, billing code, or review state. Once added, these fields become available in filters, sorting, templates, and formulas.

See [User Fields](features/user-fields.md) for details.

## Integrations

Beyond calendar sync, TaskNotes includes an HTTP API and webhook support for automation workflows, external dashboards, or custom tooling.

See [Integrations](settings/integrations.md) for details.

## Companion Plugins

TaskNotes can be extended by optional companion plugins that use the JavaScript runtime API while keeping task data in Markdown files. [Canvas Bases](companion-plugins/canvas-bases.md) is the TaskNotes canvas companion, adding canvas-style boards and JSON Canvas snapshots for Bases views, with optional TaskNotes badges, actions, and relationship edges. [TaskNotes Workflows](companion-plugins/tasknotes-workflows.md) adds Markdown-defined automation for TaskNotes events, schedules, manual commands, and typed task actions.

See [Companion Plugins](companion-plugins.md) for details.

## REST API

External applications can interact with TaskNotes through its REST API for automation, reporting, and integration with other tools.

See [HTTP API](HTTP_API.md) for details.
